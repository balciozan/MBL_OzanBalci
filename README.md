<br/>
### Web Scrapping Homework  
'Rank, Name, Year, Duration' information of the Top 50 Movies of IMDB has been scrapped from the IMBD website and written in a .csv file.

Unsolved Problems are:  
- Since ',' is a seperator in .csv, movie names which include ',' are seperated to different shells involuntarily.
- 'Year' information comes within paranthesis and it can not be removed.
- Some information such as 'Director, Gross, IMDB Rating' can not be pulled from the website.
